== DESCRIPTION

Typedown is a markdown dialect optimized for fast typing on mobile devices.
The typedown is basically a preprocessor that translates typedown to markdown,
for further processing by a markdown parser.

At the moment the typedown syntax is mainly tested with the iPod touch/iPhone iOS 
4.0.1 keyboard. It takes into account looks at how easy it is to get to important
characters on the keyboard, as well as features like auto-capitalizing.

A typical typedown document will look like this:


    ! Heading
    
    Exclamation mark is chosen because the
    first word after it is auto-capitalized. And
    it is easier to get to than the hash (#) in the 
    iPhone/iPod touch keyboard layout.
    
    //. This is a bold paragraph
    that might run through several lines
    before ending in a double line break.
    The dot ensuers the first word is 
    auto-capitalized.

    /. This paragraph is italic.
    
    Single words may be /italic/ or //bold//. Or you 
    may use standard _markdown italic_ and __bold__
    for more flexibility. The slash syntax only
    works for single words and whole words, because
    the slash may have other uses.
    
    !! Subheading
    
    As typedown is a preprocessor, one is free
    to use standard markdown. There is one exception
    though. The dash will no longer create
    bullet-lists.
    
    - Why? you ask.
    
    - It is used for dialogue instead.
    
    - Why?
    
    - I want typedown to be a tool for journalists and writers. 
    In some countries, including mine, this is a usual style for 
    writing dialogue both in newspapers, magazines and fiction.

    - Ah! you say. - I get it.

    The dash does not auto-capitalize, though. Because of this
    there is an alternative syntax:

    -. You may add dialogue like this.

    -. That dot is ugly.

    -. Yeah, I agree. But this actually is faster to type. Saves a lot of shifting.

    -. On the iPod again, I guess.

    -. How did you know? I ask.

    You grin.

       
== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

The preprocessor at present is not aware of CODE
blocks or similar, and will not leave your regexps
alone.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Typedown is presently using bluecloth as its markdown
parser.

== SYNOPSIS:

    require 'typedown'

    doc = Typedown::Document.new content
    doc << "! More content\n"
    puts doc.to_markdown
    puts doc.to_html


Section.sectionize might be nice for extracting headlines
or TOCs. 

    require 'typedown'

    root = Typedown::Section.sectionize content
    puts root.title
    puts root.body.to_markdown

    root.subsections.each do |s|
        puts root.title
        s.subsections.each do |t|
            puts s.title
            # puts s.body.to_markdown
            # puts s.body.to_html
        end
    end
